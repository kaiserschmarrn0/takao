# Takao

Welcome to the Takao source code!

Takao is a hobby project that helps me to understand how computers 
work, learn about it and, in the future, represent how I think they 
should work.




Takao now is in alpha phase where big changes and design decisions will 
happen, so it has not a specific version number.

This page is a non-comprehensive index of the Takao documentation.
