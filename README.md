# CKA
[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/18a091eb159d408ea80dd8ceb2d5bad5)](https://www.codacy.com/app/assemblyislaw/CKA?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=TheStr3ak5/CKA&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Welcome to the CKA source code, my attempt to make a kernel in C (maybe I will rewrite it later in rust, but no for the moment).

### Why CKA?
CKA stands for "C Kernel and less Assembly", reffering to my irrational hate to the assembly language (for obvious reasons).

### What do you want with CKA?
CKA is a hobby project that helps me to understand how computers work, learn about it and, in the future, represent how I think they should work.

### CKA releases:
Currently CKA is in the version 0-0-7-2, nicknamed "Prophet".
For the moment CKA is in alpha phase.

### Useful documentation:
You can find useful documentation regarding kernel panic error codes, interrupt conventions and other things, all in the "docs" directory.
### License:
CKA is distributed as a whole under the GNU GPL v3 license, for more details, read LICENSE, that is in the distributed package.

### Reporting issues:
If you experiment issues in the build process or in the runtime of the kernel you can submit your issues here: https://github.com/TheStr3ak5/CKA/issues

### Other projets:
These are other projects that I used as inspiration / educational purposes / etc.

The Daouki's project, VeloxOS : https://github.com/daouki/veloxos <- Project organization and coding conventions.
Google's Zircon project : https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/zircon <- Mostly inspiring the rewrite branch, that will become the new
CKA.
