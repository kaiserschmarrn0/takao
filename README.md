# CKA

Welcome to the CKA source code, my attempt to make a kernel in C 
(maybe I will rewrite it later in rust, but no for the moment).

CKA is a hobby project that helps me to understand how computers 
work, learn about it and, in the future, represent how I think they 
should work.

CKA stands for "C Kernel and less Assembly", referring to my irrational 
hate to the assembly language (for obvious reasons).

CKA now is in alpha phase where big changes and design decisions will 
happen, so it has not a specific version number.

This page is a non-comprehensive index of the CKA documentation.
