*NOTE: The dependecies will be soon automatically installed for determinated linux distros with "make dependencies", and the derivated
"make build-dependencies" and "make test-dependencies", functions that are not implemented for the moment*

CKA needs for it's build system the following libraries and programs:

- Make (makefiles are used in this proyect).
- clang (the proyect compiler).
- lld for linking. but can be remplaced with classic ld without any problem modifying the makefile
- gnu-efi (a library used for the EFI targets, that provides the basic things for .efi applications).

Getting these packages:

Ubuntu and variants:
	sudo apt-get install gnu-efi make
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://apt.llvm.org/artful/ llvm-toolchain-artful-5.0 main
	sudo apt-get install clang-5.0 lld-5.0
   
For testing, it depends on the architecture, but the following packages are commonly used:
- qemu (virtual machine)
- OVMF (UEFI testing)
- Mtools (also called mtools, used to access FAT disk images in the command line)
