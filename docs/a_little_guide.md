#### Author: TheStr3ak5

## Documentation structure:

CKA documentation is the main information database for developers, contributors and users to know the internals of the CKA design.
CKA documentation is divided in separate folders, some of them with different folders inside, following this scheme:

```build```  : Details in the CKA build and configuration process.  

```design``` : Details in the CKA design basis and design decissions that are depper than "what kind of memory allocator CKA uses" 
               or related.  
               
```errors``` : Explanation of the errors that CKA can report in it's use.

## How to see this documentation:

This documentation is almost completely written in markdown files (.md), this needs the use of a special reader or the use of the
web version of this documentation, the github reader will allow to read without any problems this documentation.  

If you want to install any specific software to read this documentation in your computer, I would recommend mdv (https://github.com/axiros/terminal_markdown_viewer) , since I prefer terminal programs to the graphical ones, but the choice is up to you.
